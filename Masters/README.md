This repository comprises the necessary files for the Portfolio task assigned in COMP2200/6200 S1 2023. This readme file provides an overview on what to expect from each portfolio file found in the repository. 

### intent_classifier

For this part of the assignment, a program was created that imitates a call to Optus mobile phone customer support, demonstrating a GILIICAPRA exchange. Firstly, the program will automatically play an audio that "Greets and Invites" the customer to say his/her intent. Next, the program allows the customer to say his/her intent by recording the customer's response or allowing the customer to play a recorded clip containing his/her intent. Then, the program "Listens" to the customer's intent. Afterwards, the program will "Identify the Intent" of the customer by determining if the intent of the customer falls under the following: Sales, Support, Complaints, Account Management, Billing and Payments, and will "Confirm" identified intent with the customer by playing another audio clip corresponding to the identified intent. Next, the program will allow the customer to "Accept" by recording another response or playing another audio clip that contains customer response. Lastly, based on the customer response, the program will enact its "Placeholder Reply and Act" by printing the identified intent of the customer and playing a music queue.

A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the Top 1000 Highest Grossing Dataset, created by merging two datasets obtained from Kaggle. The primary objective was to merge the datasets, clean and prepare the data, and subsequently analyze the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.To achieve this, a systematic approach was employed, involving the following steps:

Data Merging: The two datasets were combined, as each contained unique features that could have contributed to a more comprehensive analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Missing values were removed, and the data was prepared for further analysis.

Data Visualization: Box plots and histograms were utilized to gain an overview of the dataset's distribution and variation.

Feature Selection: Feature selection analysis was conducted to determine the most relevant features for model development.

Model Development: Multiple models were trained, tested, and evaluated, with their performance and accuracy compared.

Results Analysis: The results were analyzed, with conclusions and findings drawn based on the models' accuracy and insights gleaned from the analysis as a whole. At the last portion of the notebook, notes on how to further improve the study and research have been written down as well.

## Critical_Analysis
This critical analysis report aims to identify areas for improvement in training models based on the Mobile Price Dataset. The report is structured into seven main findings, each highlighting an area where improvements can be made. The report aims to provide actionable insights and sample codes (if necessary) to improve the given notebook on the Mobile Price Dataset.
